# This Python code creates a simple chatbot that provides information about government schemes in Tamil Nadu.

### Key Features:

#### Data Loading: Reads scheme data from a CSV file.
#### Scheme Search: Searches for schemes by name.
#### Information Retrieval: Extracts and displays scheme details (name, description, eligibility, benefits, application process).
#### Basic Chatbot Interaction: Allows users to input scheme names and receive information.

### Limitations:

### Potential Enhancements:

#### Database Integration: Use a more robust database for data storage.
#### Improved Search: Implement more sophisticated search algorithms.
#### Enhanced User Interface: Create a more user-friendly interface.
#### Natural Language Understanding: Integrate NLP for better query understanding.
